The sample is used directly in the upstream inference tests. It is downloaded, not committed or reuploaded by this example. Underlying imagery is Sentinel-2; no ground truth is bundled. Preserve source attribution. Model-weight licensing must not be assumed to resolve separately supplied imagery/annotation rights.

## Electron input and display

All eight Float32 bands are used at their original resolution: B4_B, B3_B, B2_B, B8_B, B4_A, B3_A, B2_A, B8_A. Normalization is embedded in the ONNX package. The source remains unchanged. The display uses the first RGB triplet, 2–98% channel stretch and alpha for invalid pixels. NoData class -1 is transparent. Valid classes are background 0, field interior 1, boundary 2. Only field interiors are polygonized/exported; model outputs are not cadastral boundaries or ground truth.
